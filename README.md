# feed_to_OPML
A Python script to convert a Feed+ db file to a standard OPML format

I have Feed+ as an Android app on my tablet but it does not have an export option. I also have an RSS Feed app on my Windows mobile so I want to use the opml file to transfer any feeds I add (The Android app is my main RSS reader)
