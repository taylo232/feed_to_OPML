# feed_to_OPML
A Python script to convert a Feed+ db file to a standard OPML format

I usually read my rss feeds on an Android tablet. However, after a long train journey with only my Windows Mobile and no feeds installed I decided to copy the rss feed list across. 

I then found that the Android software (Feed+) has no export function. I did, however, find the .db file that contained the feed lists and various pieces of config information.
